# Preface

This book emerges from the intersection of scholarship and lived experience. As someone diagnosed with Bipolar II disorder, with traits of obsessive-compulsive personality organization and a schizotypal personality structure, I have long been fascinated by the thin boundary between mystical experience and what modern psychiatry calls "madness."

My spiritual heritage as an [Alevi Kalenderi Abdal](/wiki/kaygusuz-abdal-and-alevi-mysticism)—a tradition of wandering mystical seekers within Anatolian Islam—drew me to the stories of [holy fools](/wiki/the-tradition-of-the-holy-fool-origins-and-meanings), [dervishes](/wiki/abdals-the-kalenderi-and-antinomian-dervishes), and God-intoxicated saints across religious traditions. In their ecstatic utterances, transgressive behaviors, and fierce devotion, I recognized something both alien and intimately familiar.

This book is written for three audiences:

1. **Scholars** interested in comparative mysticism, religious studies, and the phenomenology of ecstatic states
2. **Spiritual seekers** drawn to the radical paths of holy fools and Sufi dervishes
3. **People with lived experience** of mood disorders, particularly Bipolar II, who may find resonance in these mystical traditions



There are multiple paths through this material:

**Scholarly Path:** Read sequentially, engaging with the comparative theological frameworks and historical contexts.

**Devotional Path:** Focus on the hagiographical chapters (Parts I and II) and the reflection prompts, treating this as a contemplative resource.

**Therapeutic Path:** Pay special attention to Part IV on mental health perspectives, using the journaling prompts for self-exploration while maintaining regular contact with your care team.

<ClinicalWarning>

If any content triggers distressing emotions or suggests you are in crisis, please stop reading and contact a mental health professional, crisis service, or trusted member of your care team immediately. The appendices include practical resources.

</ClinicalWarning>



This work attempts to:
- Respect living religious communities and their interpretations
- Avoid romanticizing psychiatric conditions or spiritual bypassing
- Present both the beauty and the danger of ecstatic paths
- Honor the wisdom of traditional communities while engaging modern clinical knowledge
- Acknowledge the limits of comparative work

I write as both insider (to Alevi tradition and to mood disorders) and outsider (to Orthodox Christianity, to full clinical training). These positionalities shape what I see and what I miss.
